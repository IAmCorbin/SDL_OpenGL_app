SDL_OpenGL_App Notes
	
V1: Character Movement
	First tests with moving a character around seperate from the camera

V2: Re-Organize
	Cleaned up organization
	
V3: vertexArrays
	got rid of basic slow gl_Begin and gl_End calls, now using glVertexPointer, glColorPointer, and glDrawArrays to get things done

V4: staticShapesContainer+colorGradients
	Created a static vector to hold all shapes, this simplifies shape creation and drawing to single calls with automated setup and 	destruction

V5: drawAll_withSingleCall - INCOMPLETE
	created static allFaces and allFaceColors vectors to compile all shape vectors together and draw at once, for some reason can 		only get the first shape to draw. Will come back to later, reverting back to seperate draw calls for each shape for now.

V6: MovementClass
	Clean up shapes class and return to 1 seperate draw call for each shape for now (still all activated by Shape::drawAll() )
	Add a movement class that can accept a shape object to bind movement controls
